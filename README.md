# LUTSpec

This project aims to provide a standardized specification for [3D look up table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_lookup_table) (LUT) file formats.

## Test Cases

A series of input images, LUTs, and output images for each LUT. This should be helpful in ensuring LUT files can be read and processed correctly.

Find these files the `test_cases` directory.

# Uniform Type Identifiers (UTI) for LUTs

A comprehensive specification for Apple's [Uniform Type Identifiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Type_Identifier) for LUT file types.

This specification aims to also provide a standard specification for LUTs that developers of applications can use to provide a consistent user experience when opening files on Apple operating systems.

There will also be specifications for disambiguating file types that share extensions and links to relevant specifications for LUT file types.
